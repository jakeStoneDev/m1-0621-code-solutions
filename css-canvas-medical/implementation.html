            Becoming a physician will endure as your all-time best investment decision,
            and on behalf of your community, we're grateful for it. When you choose to
            invest in Canvas, we'll ensure you list Canvas as the second best investment
            you've ever made for your practice, guaranteed. Contact us when you're ready to
            discuss the details.

            <li class="listTitle">Making the Decision To Switch</li>
            <p>You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined
              that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on
              investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make
              this determination one way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox
              of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as reference
              to current customers to talk about their experience.
            </p>
            <li class="listTitle">Interfaces and Community Intergration</li>
            <p>Canvas is meant to intergrate with your existing interfaces and
              community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
              number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting
              bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred specialists
              and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is
              seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other
              information technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine
              what we can deliver and when.
            </p>
            <li class="listTitle">Data Migration</li>
            <p>The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
              current data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely
              hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import
              into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like medications, problems,
              and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes
              and documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level
              of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
            </p>
            <li class="listTitle">Training and Site Visit</li>
            <p>We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
              charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live
              to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and billing
              workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to
              work side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
            </p>
            <li class="listTitle">Go-Live and Tuning</li>
            <p>Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will
              be with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
              everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful
              of encounters in Canvas under you belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new
              automations, modifying practice managment settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.
            </p>
            <li class="listTitle">Sustained Performance</li>
            <p>All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide support
              over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not meeting
              expectations, you can terminate the agreement and recieve all payments back.
              (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS
              guarentee: if you recieve a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone,
              we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive
              partnership for us both.
